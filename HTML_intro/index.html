    <h2><a name = "description"/>Description</h2>
    <p>Henry has decided that he does not like mac and cheese. Or, he no longer wants it for every
        meal. So, I am starting to bake. More food = more sleeping (That is the goal. Henry is waking
        up at 5:30AM and I am desperate for a solution to this problem. I am so SLEEPY.) There are a few ripe bananas
        around so this seems like an easy thingy to whip up. Easy and it has sugar + fruit + carbs so putting a lot
        of faith that this solves a very big problem. Sleep is important, YO.

    <h2><a name = "ingredients"/>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
                <li>3 to 4 ripe bananas, smashed</li>
                <li>1/3 cup (75 grams) melted salted butter</li>
                <li>3/4 to 1 cup (145 to 190 grams) light brown sugar (depending on the level of sweetness you prefer, I always use the smaller amount) </li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li> 
                <li>1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon (15 ml) bourbon (optional)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon (5 grams) baking soda</li>
                <li>Pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon (3 grams) cinnamon</li>
                <li>Up to 1/2 teaspoon (1) nutmeg</li>
                <li>Pinch of ground cloves</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (190 grams) flour</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a name = "directions"/>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. </li>
                <li>With a wooden spoon, mix butter into the mashed bananas in a large mixing bowl.</li> 
                <li>Mix in the sugar, egg, vanilla and bourbon, then the spices. </li>
                <li>Sprinkle the baking soda and salt over the mixture and mix in.</li> 
                <li>Add the flour last, mix. </li>
                <li>Pour mixture into a buttered 4×8 inch loaf pan. </li>
                <li>Bake for 50 minutes to one hour, or until a tester comes out clean. </li>
                <li>Cool on a rack.</li> 
                <li>Remove from pan and slice to serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: Due to my unhealthy obsession with tiny things, 
            I split this into two mini-loaf pans. It took 45 minutes to bake two perfect halves, 
            but of course, may run longer or shorter in your oven.
